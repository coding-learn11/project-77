        <p style="margin: 50px; font-family: Cambria, Cochin, Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;">Visual Studio Code is an IDE that is used by many famous companies such as Microsoft, Alibaba Travels, and Trivago. It has support for debugging, task running, and version control. To download visual studio code, press this <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/Download" target="_blank">link.</a> Once the file has been downloaded, you can set it up. Make sure you agree with the terms and conditions to continue with the process of installing. It is also a great idea to go to the extensions section from the left side (or press ctrl + shift + x) and install the 'Go Live' extension. This extension will start working once you restart the app and it is great for testing the progress you have made so far.</p>
        
        <p style="margin: 50px; font-family: Cambria, Cochin, Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;">Console screens are what coders use to see how much of their website is working. They add a small line of coding which allows them to see what ever the piece of coding is, on the console screen of their website. To print something on to the console screen, you need to add the following piece of coding: console.log(____), you need to fill out the blank by adding the ID of whatever you want to print onto the console screen. To open the console screen: go to your website; double click anywhere, and then press 'Inspect'. A seperate screen will pop up and in the bottom you will be able to see the console screen.</p>
